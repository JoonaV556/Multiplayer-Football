input management - reading input in game logic
---------------------------------------------------

Input manager responsibilities
    (handles input on each client without server authorization)
    - reads input from buttons during networktick

    - stores data in INetworkInput struct

    - lets input users read input during each networktick

    - resets data back to zero after each networktick


    - provides objects way to read data
        - IInputConsumer
            - ConsumeInput

networked properties
---------------------------------------------------
- value can only be set by StateAuthority  

- detect changes locally by comparing local value to synced value in Update

//react to changed networked var locally 

[Networked] var Value;
private var localValue;

Update() {
    if (localValue != Value) {
        log("synced value has been changed over network");
    }
}
