just some notes for planning football game 

GAME PHASES:

1. warmup
    {
        -players can freely score goals
        -ends when all players have stood in central circle for long enough
    }
    
2. match
    {
        round loop:
            - players spawn in spawn positions & movement is locked
            - Countdown begins and round starts on 0
            - round begin
                -player movement is unlocked
                -ball is spawned in center
            - players try to score goal
            - goal is scored
                - arena score ui is updated
                - some victory sounds 
                - maybe time slowed down
                - nothing happens for couple of seconds
    => repeats from start until either team reaches 4 goals
    }

3. Victory reached
    {
        - some cool glorius music
        - player models stand on field 
            - winning players have crowns on head
            - winnnig players jump happily in place
    }

4. end - rematch or quit 
    {
        - each player gets to decide if rematch or quit
            - if all players vote rematch, restart from phase 1
            - otherwise all players disconnct & are returned to start menu
    }
